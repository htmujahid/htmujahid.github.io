## About Me

I'm a passionate MERN stack developer with experience on multiple platforms. I am a strong advocate
for clean and efficient code that is maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand. I'm always
seeking out new challenges to grow as an engineer and am highly adaptable to new technologies and
fast-paced environments. I also believe in the power of community-driven development through
open-source collaboration.
